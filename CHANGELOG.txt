version 1.1 (07/06/2019)
-----------

core:
 - don't use anymore "glabel status"
 - replace "gmultipath status" by "gmultipath list"
 - use "gpart list" for building the partitions table
 - use "gmultipath list" for completing the partitions table & devices with multipath datas

disk type detection:
 - Handle NVME disk detection
 - Handle NVRAM disk detection
 
new columns:
 - column "fs" that show the partition type (freebsd-zfs, freebsd-swap, bios-boot, ...)
 - column "path-state"  that show the multipath state's device (OPTIMAL, ...)
 - column "temp" that show the disk temperature
 - column "zpool-location" that show the location of the partition inside the pool structure (tank/mirror-0, ...)
 
new switches:
 - switch -smartctl that enable to report columns from smartctl tool (like temperature). without this switch theses columns are skipped.
 
updated profil layout:
 - "all"   report columns : pPlzZdtDUTSRHemos
 - "long"  report columns : plzdDUTSRH
 - "short" report columns : pzdDUT
 
filters:
 - the -fs:<type> filter can now handle theses types: none, all, any, zfs, swap, bios, unknown
 - many filters can now be set more than one time for accepting more than one value. This apply to [-i:<class> <entity>],  [-fs:<fstype>],  [-c:<columns>]
 
layout switchs
 - profil switch like -all, -long or -short can be used in addition of the switch [-c:<columns>]. Theses switch are merged together for defining columns to report.
